### Overview
This challenge consisted of a rust file `main.rs` that contained code for a recursive macro and a main function. 
Here is the code contained in the `main.rs` file:
```
macro_rules! check {
    (@s n1ctf{$Never:tt}) => {
        check!(stringify!($Never))
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna give you up $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Give += true as usize;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna let you down $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Give -= true as usize;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna run around and desert you $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna += true as u8;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna make you cry $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna -= true as u8;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna say goodbye $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna = $Never[$Give];
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Never[$Give] = $Gonna;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
    ($Never:expr) => {{
        fn check() -> bool {
            let mut never = $Never.as_bytes().to_vec();
            let mut gonna = false as u8;
            let mut give:usize = false as usize;
            check!(@e (never,gonna,give); (
            Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you 
            ... Repeating the same pattern ...
            Never gonna give you up Never gonna give never gonna give
            ));
        }
        check()
    }};
    (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna give never gonna give)) => {
        let you = [148u8, 59, 143, 112, 121, 186, 106, 133, 55, 90, 164, 166, 167, 121, 174, 147, 148, 167, 99, 86, 81, 161, 151, 149, 132, 56, 88, 188, 141, 127, 151, 63];
        return $Never == you;
    };
}

fn main() {
    let result = check!(@s \*Insert guess*\);
    if result {
        println!("Yes");
    }
}
```

### Macros

So that's a lot to look at when you first open the file. At the top we have a macro called `check` defined and we see in the `main` function that this is what is initially called. The rest of the functions inside of `check` all call `check!` as well. I'm not an expert in rust and this was actually my first time encountering the language so by no means can I completely explain what a macro is. [This](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html) is the official reference on macros that I used to supplement my understanding but overall, I treated the code as functions as we will see in my solution.

---
### Starting Out
I originally just wanted to change the comment in `main`: `check!(@s \*Insert guess*\)` so that I could run the program without crashing. After many tries of random strings and numbers, I noticed that the function at the top of the file
``` 
    (@s n1ctf{$Never:tt}) => {
        check!(stringify!($Never))
    };
```
took `n1ctf{\*Some string*\}` as input. So I got the program to run by changing the comment in `main` to `check!(@s n1ctf{A})`.
I then began to put the pieces together. Towards the bottom of the file there was an expression that had a return statement in it.
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna give never gonna give)) => {
        let you = [148u8, 59, 143, 112, 121, 186, 106, 133, 55, 90, 164, 166, 167, 121, 174, 147, 148, 167, 99, 86, 81, 161, 151, 149, 132, 56, 88, 188, 141, 127, 151, 63];
        return $Never == you;
    };
```
None of the other expressions had return statements so I concluded that this was the last expression evaluated in the long recursive sequence. I was particularly interested in the contents of the array `you` and began to theorize that this was the flag but shifted in some way because as shown above, the input included `n1ctf{$Never:tt}` where `$Never` is compared to `you` in the return statement of the expression shown above.
My first idea was to check that the contents of `you` were not just ASCII characters but if you take a look at the values, some are in the ASCII range and some not so I began to develop the idea that they were shifted in the course of the function.
---
### Redefining the Code
If you take a look at each of the expressions in the file under the first one, you can redefine them according to an initial input array of chars `input` and an index of the current element `idx` and a copy of the value `val` of the current element.

I'll show you how I redefined each expression in order from the top.
1. The first expression I didn't need to redefine since it just took the string out of the flag format (`n1ctf{}`) and called `check!` with `$Never` as a string argument.
```
(@s n1ctf{$Never:tt}) => {
        check!(stringify!($Never))
    };
```
This is called when `check!` sees `n1ctf{\*Some string*\}`.
2. The expression under that:
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna give you up $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Give += true as usize;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
- `$Never` is equivalent to our input array of chars which we will call `input`. 
- `$Gonna` is equivalent to our current char in the array which we will call `val` but is not set by this expression.
- `$Give` is equivalent to our current index which we will call `idx`. 

This expression increments give by one because it's adding the value `true as usize` which I assumed to be equivalent to 1 and then it is passing in the new `$Give` to `check!`.
Another thing to note is that this expression is only called when `check!` sees "Never gonna give you up " at the start of `($($code*))`. It then strips this value off `($($code*))` and sends the rest of *the very long string* into the recursive call. This aspect will make more sense later when we get to *the very long string* in the middle of the file.
This is called when `check!` sees "Never gonna give you up ".
3. The next expression decrements `$Give` (`idx`) and is very similar to the one above:
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna let you down $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Give -= true as usize;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
This is called when `check!` sees "Never gonna let you down ".
4. Similarly, the next expression increments `$Gonna` (`val`) in the same way as the above two:
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna run around and desert you $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna += true as u8;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
This is called when `check!` sees "Never gonna run around and desert you ".
5. This one decrements `$Gonna` (`val`):
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna make you cry $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna -= true as u8;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
This is called when `check!` sees "Never gonna make you cry ".
6. The next expression sets `$Gonna` to the value at the current array index `$Never[$Give]` (`val = input[idx]`):
```
 (@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna say goodbye $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Gonna = $Never[$Give];
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
This is called when `check!` sees "Never gonna say goodbye ".
7. The next expression sets the value at the current array index `$Never[$Give]` to the value `$Gonna` (`input[idx] = val`):
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you $($code:tt)*)) => {
        $Never[$Give] = $Gonna;
        check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));
    };
```
8. This expression is the big one. It defines the flow of the code. *The very long string* in the middle is slowly stripped off throughout the execution of the code so we know based on how we've defined the above expressions that whatever substring is at the front of *the very long string* will dictate what expression is called:
```
($Never:expr) => {{
        fn check() -> bool {
            let mut never = $Never.as_bytes().to_vec();
            let mut gonna = false as u8;
            let mut give:usize = false as usize;
            check!(@e (never,gonna,give); (
            Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna run around and desert you ... going on for some time ...
            Never gonna give you up Never gonna give never gonna give
            ));
        }
        check()
    }};
```
For example, the first expression called sets `$Gonna` to the value at the current array index `$Never[$Give]` because the first recognizable substring of *the very long string* is "Never gonna say goodbye ". *The very long string* minus the front substring is what keeps getting passed into the rest of the recursive form. When we see the recursive call `check!(@e ($Never,$Gonna,$Give); ($($code)*));` in other expressions the `($($code)*));` is *the very long string* with the front substring stripped off that coorelates to whatever substring caused that expression to be called.
9. The last function checks if `$Never` (`input`) is equal to `you` and returns the result:
```
(@e ($Never:expr,$Gonna:expr,$Give:expr); (Never gonna give never gonna give)) => {
        let you = [148u8, 59, 143, 112, 121, 186, 106, 133, 55, 90, 164, 166, 167, 121, 174, 147, 148, 167, 99, 86, 81, 161, 151, 149, 132, 56, 88, 188, 141, 127, 151, 63];
        return $Never == you;
    };
```

---
### The Solution
Taking all this into account, I created a python program that mapped each of these expressions to a function and worked my way back from what I assumed the final expectation in `you`.
```
x = the very long string (I didn't put it here for readability reasons)
incidx = "Never gonna give you up "
decidx = "Never gonna let you down "
incval = "Never gonna run around and desert you "
decval = "Never gonna make you cry "
getval = "Never gonna say goodbye "
setval = "Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you "
idx = 0
val = 0
final = [148, 59, 143, 112, 121, 186, 106, 133, 55, 90, 164, 166, 167, 121, 174, 147, 148, 167, 99, 86, 81, 161, 151, 149, 132, 56, 88, 188, 141, 127, 151, 63]
while x[:len("Never gonna give never gonna give")] != "Never gonna give never gonna give":
    # incidx
    if x[:len(incidx)] == incidx:
        print(x)
        idx = idx + 1
        x = x[len(incidx):]
    # decidx
    if x[:len(decidx)] == decidx:
        print("decidx")
        idx = idx - 1
        x = x[len(decidx):]
    # incval
    if x[:len(incval)] == incval:
        print("incval")
        val = val - 1
        x = x[len(incval):]
    # decval
    if x[:len(decval)] == decval:
        print("decval")
        val = val + 1
        x = x[len(decval):]
    # getval
    if x[:len(getval)] == getval:
        print("getval")
        val = final[idx]
        x = x[len(getval):]
    # setval
    if x[:len(setval)] == setval:
        print("setval")
        final[idx] = val
        x = x[len(setval):]
    
for i in range(0, len(final)):
    print(chr(final[i]), end="")
```
Note: I reversed the implementation of the increment index/value and decrement index/value functions because we're working from the final solution back to the initial input. Also, x should be equal to *the very long string*.
I ran this code and got the flag as `n1ctf{A6C33EA2571A2AE26BFAE7BEA2CD8F54}`.
I put this into the website and got success although I still hit recursion limit on `main.rs`.

Thanks for reading :)
